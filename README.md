How to use this tiktok follow, like, share, view and favorites bot (this is a really complicated process but its worthy) - Tutorial for Windows 10/11:
1. Download the python file thats above (if you dont have python go to the official site and install it and then install the python file from the github)
2. Open the file with notepad and change line 19 and 20 so instead of "pc" it is your windows account username
3. Download portable chrome from this site: https://www.filehorse.com/download-google-chrome-portable-64/80543/download/ (THIS EXACT ONE, NOT ANOTHER VERSION)
4. While setting up the portable chrome, make sure when you are in that section where you select the path it gets installed to, remember where that path is. (It should be in C:\Users\*Your Windows Account Username*\PortableApps\GoogleChromePortable64\GoogleChromePortable.exe)
5. Download chromedriver_win32.zip from this site: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/114.0.5735.90/chromedriver_win32.zip
6. Extract chromedriver.exe from the zip file you just downloaded and move it to the path where the portable version of Google Chrome has been installed (C:\Users\*Your Windows Account Username*\PortableApps\GoogleChromePortable64)
7. After that the only thing you have to do is close the portable version of Google Chrome if you had it open, and run the python file you downloaded from the github and follow these steps if you dont know what to do:
- After opening the file, the Command Prompt App will open, and the portable version of Google Chrome will open, opening afterwards the https://zefoy.com page (make sure you dont touch anything in this process)
- After it does that, in the Command Prompt App, a text will display saying that you have 15 seconds to complete the captcha in the https://zefoy.com page from the portable version of Google Chrome. Make sure you do so in time, otherwise it will not work.
- It should show a bunch of options, choose the one u want using the numbers beside them (ex: 5 for shares) and type it and click enter.
- Now paste the video link where you want the action to happen, and then click enter.
- Now sit pack and enjoy as you are getting all the appreciation you wanted.

Q&A:
Q: Is this safe?
A: Yes, it is, it's also open source, so you can check if there's anything malicious in the code (which there isn't, if you dont believe me check it out yourself)

Q: Is this original?
A: I'd say it is, it's a modified version of an old bot which had many errors. I have changed it so it works and won't give any errors!

Q: Is the discord server for support?
A: Nah, I didn't know what to put as a link for the discord server and I didn't want to create a new server just for this shitty project of mine.

Thanks for understanding, have fun botting!
